          Where to stay in Zagreb Zagreb is the capital city of Croatia and a
          great place to start your Croatian trip. If you too are visiting the
          Croatian capital city but donâ€™t know where to stay in Zagreb, we share
          here the best areas to stay in Zagreb and the best Zagreb
          accommodations in each of these Zagreb neighborhoods.

          <br />
          For many years, Zagreb hotels catered almost exclusively to business
          travelers, but it's not the case any longer. And while, during the
          summer, Zagreb still remains a transit town that travelers visit for a
          day or two before heading to the coast, the number of visitors who at
          least spend a night in Zagreb increases every year. And so do the
          number and choice of Zagreb accommodation.
